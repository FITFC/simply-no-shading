# Simply No Shading

This mod, by default, mimics OptiFine's Internal Shader with Old Lighting OFF. The benefit is the absence of lag that is present to any shader, including Internal Shader. You also have the freedom to select which and which not this mod affects and may bind keys to toggle them in-game, though it hasn't yet supported every possible feature.

## Configuration

The screen for configuring this mod can be found `Options > Video Settings > Shading Settings`. However, as you notice, in sodium it is `Options > Video Settings`, Shading tab. Alternatively, if you have modmenu installed, go to `Mods > Simply No Shading > Configure`.

---

The screen for configuring keys can be found in `Options > Controls > Key Binds`, then scroll down and you'll see the Shading category.
